audit 相关的配置，此审计与用户态调用相关
内核命令行参数，可以控制audit的启动
grub.cfg 中 audit=0 ，则不启动audit内核模块

DEVELOPER runs autoconf and automake:
autoconf -- creates shippable configure script
(which the installer will later run to make the Makefile)
‘autoconf’ is a macro processor.
It converts configure.ac, which is a shell script using macro instructions, into configure, a full-fledged shell script.
automake - creates shippable Makefile.in data file
(which configure will later read to make the Makefile)
Automake helps with creating portable and GNU-standard compliant Makefiles.
‘automake’ creates complex Makefile.ins from simple Makefile.ams
INSTALLER runs configure, make and sudo make install:
./configure       # Creates  Makefile        (from     Makefile.in).  
make              # Creates  the application (from the Makefile just created).  

sudo make install # Installs the application 
                  #   Often, by default its files are installed into /usr/local
INPUT/OUTPUT MAP
Notation below is roughly: inputs --> programs --> outputs

DEVELOPER runs these:

configure.ac -> autoconf -> configure (script) --- (*.ac = autoconf)
configure.in --> autoconf -> configure (script) --- (configure.in depreciated. Use configure.ac)

Makefile.am -> automake -> Makefile.in ----------- (*.am = automake)

INSTALLER runs these:

Makefile.in -> configure -> Makefile (*.in = input file)

Makefile -> make ----------> (puts new software in your downloads or temporary directory)
Makefile -> make install -> (puts new software in system directories)

%bcond_with test1
%bcond_without test2
without -> 1
